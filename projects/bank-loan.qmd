## Overview

Built a full loan-risk simulator in Excel that scores 300+ applicants, classifies them into risk tiers, and shows how approval rates shift when credit or DTI weights change. Designed configurable scoring tables, dynamic XLOOKUP logic, and a real-time dashboard that lets managers test lending policies and visualize portfolio risk.

## What I Did

- Defined the business objective, metric targets, and analysis scope.
- Built and validated the data, modeling, and reporting workflow.
- Packaged outputs for stakeholder interpretation and decision support.

## Results/Impact

Delivered an analysis workflow with decision-ready outputs and reusable artifacts.

## Project Notes


Description: Built a full loan-risk simulator in Excel that scores 300+ applicants, classifies them into risk tiers, and shows how approval rates shift when credit or DTI weights change. Designed configurable scoring tables, dynamic XLOOKUP logic, and a real-time dashboard that lets managers test lending policies and visualize portfolio risk.
Skills Demonstrated: Dashboard, Excel, Risk Modeling, XLOOKUP
Project Status: Completed


I wanted to understand how banks score loan applicants and how small policy changes can shift approval rates. So, I built an interactive risk-rating model in Excel that scores 300+ simulated applicants, classifies them into risk tiers, and shows how portfolio approval changes when credit or debt-to-income weights are adjusted.

The project combines a full scoring configuration system, a working data model, and a professional-grade dashboard that mirrors the kind of portfolio monitoring tools used in finance and lending.

## Executive Summary

- **Objective:** Build a transparent loan risk model with adjustable scoring and dynamic portfolio insights.
- **Scope:** 3-sheet Excel system (Configuration, Applicants, Dashboard) with formulas, XLOOKUP logic, and interactive weight controls.
- **Outcome:** A functional credit-risk simulator that visualizes approval trends and helps explain how score weighting drives lending decisions.

---

## Objective

Design a model that can:

1. Evaluate applicant data (age, income, credit score, debt ratio, etc.) using point-based scoring.
2. Assign a total weighted risk score and classify applicants as High, Medium, or Low risk.
3. Simulate policy adjustments by changing the weight of specific factors like Credit Score or Debt-to-Income ratio.
4. Visualize portfolio health through KPIs and charts that update dynamically.

## Loan Scoring Configuration

Each scoring factor is fully configurable. Tables define how many points an applicant earns for different ranges:

- **Age Scoring** €“ Rewards experience while avoiding overexposure to young, unproven applicants.
- **Income Scoring** €“ Adds stability points at higher income thresholds.
- **Debt-to-Income Scoring** €“ Penalizes excessive leverage.
- **Employment Years Scoring** €“ Values job consistency.
- **Credit Score Scoring** €“ Maps ranges to increasing trust levels.
- **Previous Default** €“ Zero points if €œYes,€ full points if €œNo.€

The **Weights Table** lets you rebalance importance across factors. For instance, increasing the Credit or DTI weight instantly changes every applicant€™s total score. The **Risk Level Table** then translates those totals into final classifications: High, Medium, or Low risk.

## Applicant Data Engine

The applicant sheet acts as a live model engine. It holds raw data for 300+ records and processes each row through lookup formulas and conditional logic.

- **Columns:** demographics, financial variables, scoring by factor, weighted total, risk level, and final decision.
- **Logic:** XLOOKUPs retrieve point values from configuration tables. Weighted totals are calculated dynamically.
- **Decision Rule:** Loans are auto-approved for Low-risk, sometimes approved for Medium-risk (40% chance), and rejected for High-risk.

Conditional formatting highlights approval status and risk categories. The dataset effectively becomes a full miniature credit department, complete with applicant scoring, decision outcomes, and visual segmentation bands (Income, Credit, DTI).

## Dashboard Overview

The final dashboard ties it all together. It€™s split into three clear sections:

**1. Portfolio KPIs**

Shows total applicants, overall approval rate, average credit score, and default history (all updating automatically as weights change).

**2. What-If Policy Simulator**

Two spinner controls adjust the weighting of Credit Score and DTI. Managers can test how tightening or loosening criteria affects overall approvals in real time.

**3. Visual Statistics**

Three interactive visuals show:

- **Applications by Risk Level** €“ portfolio composition.
- **Weighted Loan Score Distribution** €“ balance of creditworthiness.
- **Approval Rate by Risk Level** €“ efficiency vs. prudence trade-off.

## Scoring Logic Example

Every applicant€™s **WeightedTotal** follows this structure:

```
= (Age_Points * Age_Weight) +
  (Income_Points * Income_Weight) +
  (Credit_Points * Credit_Weight) +
  (DTI_Points * DTI_Weight) +
  (Employment_Points * Employment_Weight) +
  (Default_Points * Default_Weight)
```

The score then maps through the **Risk Level Table** using an XLOOKUP:

```
=XLOOKUP(Q4,risk[Score_Min],risk[Risk_Level],,-1)
```

Finally, the **Decision** column determines approval, using an applicant€™s credit score as the deciding factor:

```
=IF(R4="High","Rejected",
   IF(R4="Low","Approved",
   IF(H4>=700,"Approved",
   IF(RAND()<0.3,"Approved","Rejected"))))
```

This blend of business logic and randomization makes the dataset behave like a real-life portfolio.

## Insights and Observations

Running simulations revealed that small weighting shifts have huge downstream effects:

- Increasing **DTI Weight** by 1 point reduced approvals by nearly 10%.
- Raising **Credit Weight** rewarded strong credit but slightly penalized high-income applicants with moderate scores.
- The majority of approved loans came from the Medium risk band, showing that most lending volume lives in the €œgray zone.€

These results mirror real banking behavior, as every adjustment to a credit policy changes portfolio health and risk exposure.

## What I Learned

I learned that credit risk modeling is a balancing act between fairness and caution. Building the configuration tables made me think in a way that a policy analyst would, not just a data student. The simulator showed how subjective €œweights€ directly shape real-world outcomes.

It also taught me how powerful Excel can be as an analytical sandbox when designed intentionally, with structure, logic flow, and a visual narrative all in one file.

## Conclusion

- Built a fully functioning bank loan risk simulator in Excel.
- Modeled scoring logic for six key applicant factors.
- Automated approval decisions through dynamic lookups.
- Designed an interactive dashboard with real-time policy adjustment.
- Identified approval patterns and risk trade-offs through simulation.
