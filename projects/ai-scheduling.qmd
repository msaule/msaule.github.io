![Project cover](../images/projects/ai-scheduling/cover.png){.cover-image}

## Overview

Built an AI-assisted scheduling dashboard in Power BI that identifies hospital bottlenecks, forecasts patient demand, and recommends operational improvements. Analyzed 25K appointment records, used AI visuals for driver analysis, and delivered a decision-ready tool that highlights delay risks, utilization gaps, and actionable optimization strategies.

## What I Did

- Defined the business objective, metric targets, and analysis scope.
- Built and validated the data, modeling, and reporting workflow.
- Packaged outputs for stakeholder interpretation and decision support.

## Results/Impact

Delivered an analysis workflow with decision-ready outputs and reusable artifacts.

## Project Notes


Description: Built an AI-assisted scheduling dashboard in Power BI that identifies hospital bottlenecks, forecasts patient demand, and recommends operational improvements. Analyzed 25K appointment records, used AI visuals for driver analysis, and delivered a decision-ready tool that highlights delay risks, utilization gaps, and actionable optimization strategies.
Skills Demonstrated: AI, Forecasting, Operational Efficiency, PowerBI
Project Status: Planning

### Overview

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** that uses **AI-assisted analytics** to identify scheduling bottlenecks, forecast patient demand, and recommend optimization strategies for hospital departments.

Built with **Copilot integration**, this project simulates how healthcare systems can apply data science and automation to improve patient access and operational efficiency.

---

### Objectives

- Analyze department-level wait times, no-show rates, and utilization trends.
- Use **AI forecasting** to project future appointment volume.
- Identify key factors driving scheduling delays through **Key Influencers** analysis.
- Generate automated **Copilot recommendations** for operational improvement.

---

### Tools & Skills Used

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Tools** | Power BI, Copilot Pro, Excel (for synthetic data prep) |
| **Techniques** | Data modeling, DAX calculations, Key Influencers & Decomposition Tree, forecasting models |
| **AI Components** | Power BI Copilot + built-in AI visuals |
| **Data Size** | 25,000 synthetic appointment records |
| **Key Metrics** | Wait time (minutes), no-show rate (%), utilization (%), lead time (days) |

![Screenshot 2025-10-30 213821.png](../images/projects/ai-scheduling/Screenshot_2025-10-30_213821.png)

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview of scheduling performance.

**Key Features:**

- **KPI Cards:** Average wait time, no-show rate, and utilization rate.
- **Forecast Chart:** 6-month projection of appointment demand with AI forecasting.
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Department-level comparison of wait time and no-show rate.
- **Dynamic Slicers:** Filter by department, provider, insurance type, visit type, and telehealth.

**Insight Example:**

> Pediatrics and Cardiology departments show higher no-show rates, while Self-Pay patients experience longer scheduling delays.

![Screenshot 2025-10-30 213839.png](../images/projects/ai-scheduling/Screenshot_2025-10-30_213839.png)

**Purpose:** Explore -why- delays happen and -how- to improve scheduling efficiency.

**Key Features:**

- **Key Influencers Visual:** Reveals that Self-Pay patients and April appointments increase the likelihood of 15-21-day waits by 13-18%.
- **Decomposition Tree:** Explores utilization patterns by Department - Provider - Visit Type.
- **AI Narrative Section:** Copilot summarizes insights and suggests process improvements.

**Copilot-Generated Example Insight:**

> -Telehealth appointments reduce average wait times by 1.6 days. Self-Pay segments show 13% higher delay risk. Recommend prioritizing Q2 Telehealth capacity for Pediatrics and automating Self-Pay verification workflows.-

### Dataset Summary

![image.png](../images/projects/ai-scheduling/image.png)

Synthetic dataset generated to simulate realistic hospital scheduling data with:

- **25,000 rows** across Departments, Providers, Insurance types, and Visit types.
- **Variables:** Appointment day, slots booked, slots available, wait time (days), no-show flag, utilization ratio, telehealth status, and payer type.
- **Derived Columns:** Utilization %, Wait Time Band (for Key Influencers), Year-Month.

---

### Technical Highlights

- Created **calculated columns** using DAX:
    - `Utilization = SlotsBooked / SlotsAvailable`
    - `WaitTimeBand` for categorical AI analysis.
- Configured **AI Forecast** to predict 3-month future booking trends.
- Leveraged **Copilot** to produce narrative insights and optimization strategies.

---

### Key Outcomes

| Goal | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Forecast patient demand | Achieved 6-month forward projection with confidence interval |
| Identify bottlenecks | Highlighted Self-Pay and Pediatrics as delay drivers |
| Integrate AI decision support | Generated Copilot recommendations for resource reallocation |
| Create executive-ready visuals | Two-page Power BI design with interactive slicers and KPIs |

### Reflection

This project pushed me to combine **healthcare analytics** with **AI-assisted business intelligence**. Instead of only tracking metrics, I built a dashboard that *thinks - so* forecasting demand, uncovering patterns, and recommending real actions.
