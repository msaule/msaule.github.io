## Background

I am a Business Analytics student at BYU-Idaho (4.0 GPA) building a long-term career at the intersection of analytics, operations, and systems strategy. My academic path is deliberately technical and operational: Business Analytics major with minors in Statistics and Supply Chain Management.

## What Drives My Work

I think in systems:

- bottlenecks
- risk surfaces
- thresholds for intervention
- tradeoffs under real constraints

I am not interested in surface-level reporting. I am interested in building analytics that change decisions.

Healthcare impact is personal for me. Family health challenges shaped how I think about meaningful work. That is why I am deeply committed to operational and platform-level analytics that improve patient outcomes and system reliability.

## Technical Profile

- Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, simulation
- SQL: joins, CTEs, normalization, optimization, analytics views
- R: tidyverse, regression, statistical modeling
- BI: Power BI (DAX, decomposition trees, KPI design), Excel forecasting
- Systems: ETL workflows, relational schema design, reproducible pipelines

## Working Style

- high ownership
- high intensity
- strategic and long-horizon
- values-driven and impact-focused
- most effective in autonomous, complex build environments

## One-Line Identity

Data and analytics builder designing decision-grade systems for complex organizations, with a focus on operational risk, healthcare impact, and systems thinking.
