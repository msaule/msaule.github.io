## What I Do

I help organizations make better decisions with data, fast.

My work sits at the intersection of business analytics, machine learning, and operational strategy. I build systems that do more than explain the past; they guide the next best action with clarity and confidence.

## How I Work

- I start with the decision, not the dashboard.
- I prioritize business impact over technical theater.
- I design outputs that leaders can trust and teams can execute.

## Domains I Care About

- Healthcare operations and patient access
- Fraud detection and risk analytics
- Forecasting and resource optimization
- Executive storytelling with data

## Why Teams Work With Me

I combine technical depth with business communication. That means fewer black-box deliverables and more decision tools that stakeholders actually use.

If your team needs analytics that are practical, explainable, and outcome-oriented, we should connect.
